## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Apart from different usage of properties, My personal learning is design layout/ plan. For such a long landing page structural plan (splitting layout into different parts,finding common points, organizing a workflow,) may help to code easily.

I aimed to keep the CSS DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) as much as possible. However, If you see anything just let me know.
